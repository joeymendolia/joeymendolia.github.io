                        <p>Featuring Chicago-based jazz musicians, and bars scattered throughout most of the aquarium, Jazzin’ at the Shedd is a weekly event flocked to by mostly young adult couples and families. While the event brings in a large audience, there’s more than enough room for visitors to float from one exhibit to another, drink in hand, marveling at the alien-like creatures bathing in the blue-green light just on the other side of the glass.</p>

                        <p>“It’s a laid-back atmosphere for people to have fun and learn something,” said Colleen Martin, a volunteer and former aquarist of special exhibits at Shedd Aquarium.</p>

                        <p>But it’s not all fun and games. There’s some learning involved too.</p>

                        <p>Mixed in with the jazz, drink, food and fish is an educational Q-and-A series, Jazzin’ Science Pub, which features scientists and researchers each Wednesday from 7-8 p.m.</p>

                        <p>Dan Egan, an award-winning author, two-time finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and a reporter at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, spoke at Wednesday night’s science pub.</p>

                        <p>“Once people are educated, then the game changes,” said Egan.</p>

                        <p>Speaking mostly about environmental subjects covered in his recently published book, “The Death and Life of the Great Lakes,” which won the J. Anthony Lukas Award and was a finalist of the Pulitzer Prize, Egan educated the audience on the drastic effects invasive species have had on the health of the Great Lakes.</p>

                        <p>“The Great Lakes are ecologically naïve because they are comparatively so young,” said Egan. “The wolf of the system was the Lake Trout, the one that really controlled the flow of energy. Then the lampreys came in, thanks to the St. Lawrence Seaway, and knocked them out.”</p>

                        <p>Following the Q-and-A, visitors could travel out of the auditorium, and view live lampreys, complete with their rows of concentric razor sharp teeth.</p>

                        <p>Jazzin’ at the Shedd, while a fun place to hang out and relax after a long day of work, highlights the importance of presenting scientific information in a fun, digestible and entertaining manner.</p>

                        <p>“It’s fun, but it really gives another opportunity for people to come here and learn about the animals,” said Martin.</p>

                        <p>Jazzin’ at the Shedd is held every Wednesday from June 21 to Sept. 13. Tickets start at $20. Food and drinks are sold separately</p>
